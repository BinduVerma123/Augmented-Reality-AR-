# Augmented-Reality-AR-

AR is a technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view.

AR.js is an efficient Augmented Reality solution on the Web. It runs 100% in your web browser, this means no app to install! There is no need for a specific device either e.g. Tango or iphone. It runs on all mobile platforms: Android, iOS11 and Windows mobile. You can use it with your own phone.

 ðŸ‘‰ Web-based : It is a pure web solution, so no installation required. Full javascript based on three.js + jsartoolkit5 

 ðŸ‘‰Standards : It works on any phone with webgl and webrtc.
